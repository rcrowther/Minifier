Why?
~~~~~
Those online compressors are more of a demonstration of web-building than a useful tool. This is more of a useful tool than a demonstration of web-building. It assumes you have a website (development/staging, whatever) and need to sometimes minify files. That's why the routes are internally fixed (you don't need to change them much, do you?). But you may need to add and subtract files, which is why it will select files.

Uses the YUI compressor, available separately. Not the last word in compression, but at least you know how it works. 


Requires
~~~~~~~~
YUI compressor, Python3, GTK environment, and some setup. Instructions included.
