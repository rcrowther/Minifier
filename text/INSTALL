= Install
No build tools (thank goodness)

== Requires
Python3, GTK environment, YUI compressor

== Get the compressor and put it somewhere sensible.

== Install the GSettings schema

== Change internal settings
Look in the script. All settings are annotated.

Mostly, you need to point the compressor at the YUI jar, and target some CSS/JS file folders.

== Run
From a terminal,
 
./Minifier

Select files, then minify.
